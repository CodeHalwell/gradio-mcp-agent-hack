# MCP Hub - Multi-Agent AI Research & Code Assistant

🚀 **Advanced multi-agent system for AI-powered research and code generation**

## What is MCP Hub?

MCP Hub is a sophisticated multi-agent research and code assistant built using Gradio's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server functionality. It orchestrates specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive research capabilities and generate executable Python code.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents working in orchestrated workflows
- 🔍 **Intelligent Research**: Web search with automatic summarization and citation formatting
- 💻 **Code Generation**: Context-aware Python code creation with secure execution
- 🔗 **MCP Server**: Built-in MCP server for seamless agent communication
- 🎯 **Multiple LLM Support**: Compatible with Nebius, OpenAI, Anthropic, and HuggingFace
- 🛡️ **Secure Execution**: Modal sandbox environment for safe code execution
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: Advanced metrics collection and health monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Configure your environment** by setting up API keys in the Settings tab
2. **Choose your LLM provider** (Nebius recommended for best performance)
3. **Input your research query** in the Orchestrator Flow tab
4. **Watch the magic happen** as agents collaborate to research and generate code

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Agents

- **Question Enhancer**: Breaks down complex queries into focused sub-questions
- **Web Search Agent**: Performs targeted searches using Tavily API
- **LLM Processor**: Handles text processing, summarization, and analysis
- **Citation Formatter**: Manages academic citation formatting (APA style)
- **Code Generator**: Creates contextually-aware Python code
- **Code Runner**: Executes code in secure Modal sandboxes
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the complete workflow
